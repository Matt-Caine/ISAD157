#### Final Prototype .Zip Can be found above:

The following report and Code Repo relates to my ISAD157 Module. The report outlines the different requirements, the process of designing, the database, as well as the design and functionality requirements of my C# application. 

The aim of this assignment is to focus on the analysis and design of a data application that will store Facebook users, their interconnecting relationships, messages and workplace. 

I will be using MySQL workbench as the mechanism to store the data and C# - written in Visual Studio, to illustrate a sample interface for my model.
